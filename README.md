# Project 4 - Giphman

Project 4 with General Assembly.
Project 4 is to DECIDE YOUR OWN PROJECT that pushes you OUTSIDE of your comfort zone AND looks visually pleasing.
~ This time....I....present to you ~

## Giphman

- Hangman but....using gifs!!!

The aim now is to create a pure front end app that uses a giphy API.

This is the current plan:

## Pseudo Code

Pick a random word (APININJA)
Find hints (GIPHYAPI)

While the word has not been guessed {
Show the player their current progress
Get a guess from the player
If the player wants to quit the game {
Quit the game
}
Else If the guess is not a single letter {
Tell the player to pick a single letter
}
Else {
If the guess is in the word {
Update the player's progress with the guess
}
}
}
Congratulate the player on guessing the word

## AIPs Used

_[API Ninjas](https://api-ninjas.com/api/randomword)_

_[Giphy Developers](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api/#quick-start-guide)_

## Useful Resources

Okay so google.com & youtube.com has been a huge help but exactly what has been useful? If you're looking to make your own hangman - Definitely learn what HTML DOM Events are and experiment with everything you see.

_[W3schools - HTML DOM Events](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_event.asp)_

## Bugs

Some words don't seem to exist in Giphy and others do - Take this word for instance:

- Duplicidentata (No Have)
- Fovea (Actually does)

Some queries don't have enough items to have 3 gifs appear.

- unmalleable (only has 1 item available)

I'm ALWAYS a winner.

## An RSS newsfeed (Scrapped that)

- Newspaper but....Digital!!!

## MangaLuva (Scrapped that)

- Canva but....Manga creating!!!

## MermaidTail (Scrapped that)

- Flappy Bird but....Underwater with a mermaid!!!

(Under teacher recommendations I changed my ideas).
