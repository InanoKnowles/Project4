# Project 4 - Giphman

Project 4 with General Assembly.
Project 4 is to DECIDE YOUR OWN PROJECT that pushes you OUTSIDE of your comfort zone AND looks visually pleasing.
~ This time....I....present to you ~

## Giphman

- Hangman but....using gifs!!!

The aim now is to create a pure front end app that uses a giphy API.

This is the current plan:

## Pseudo Code

Pick a random word (APININJA)
Find hints (GIPHYAPI)

While the word has not been guessed {
Show the player their current progress
Get a guess from the player
If the player wants to quit the game {
Quit the game
}
Else If the guess is not a single letter {
Tell the player to pick a single letter
}
Else {
If the guess is in the word {
Update the player's progress with the guess
}
}
}
Congratulate the player on guessing the word
