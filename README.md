# Project 4 - Giphman

Project 4 with General Assembly.

Project 4 is to DECIDE YOUR OWN PROJECT that pushes you OUTSIDE of your comfort zone AND looks visually pleasing.

My first attempt at doing this concept FAILED nonetheless feel free to scroll down to :diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside: to see what I made, how I got there and then come all the way back up here to see the glow up. All the other project ideas that got scrapped due to time restraints and current lack of skills and knowledge/confidence at this point in time as a novice - I will tackle them as personal projects in the near future but for now let us focus on making GIPHMAN GREAT AGAIN.

:relieved: :relieved: :relieved:

:white_check_mark: Users can guess the word|phrase,

:white_check_mark: A word|phrase getting represented with images that Users can see as a hint,

:white_check_mark: User limitations (Users cannot click on the same letter over and over again),

:white_check_mark: Counters for remaining guesses and incorrect guesses,

:white_check_mark: Leaderboard(fugly)

## TOOLS

- HTML
- CSS
- JAVASCRIPT
- REACT JS
- SURGE
- GOOGLE
- NODE JS

## CHALLENGES

- My perception of what I am being asked to do verses what the teacher is actually asking me to do

- Understanding REACT js and overcoming my fear of using it was a huge mental challenge for me 

- Some functions that I found challenging in the beginning but eventually got to work:

- map(): Creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

- filter(): Creates a shallow copy of a portion of a given array, filtered down to just the elements from the given array that pass the test implemented by the provided function.

- every(): Tests whether all elements in the array pass the test implemented by the provided function. It returns a Boolean value.

- some(): Tests whether at least one element in the array passes the test implemented by the provided function. It returns true if, in the array, it finds an element for which the provided function returns true; otherwise it returns false. It doesn't modify the array.

- useEffect(): The Effect Hook lets you perform side effects in function components. Tells React that your component needs to do something after render. React will remember the function you passed and call it later after performing the DOM updates.

- Accepting defeat: I believe what I created hits MVP (Its better than the MVP requirements) I even managed to pull off miracles using REACT js and deploying on my own for the first time. A lot of questions couldn't be answered because technically it was after the course so I had to tackle this resubmission completely alone without anymore guidance. For someone like me who has no prior experience in coding this was pretty damn awesome. Yay good work me :tada:  *surprised party time* :tada:

## NEW BUGS

- Some phrases are TOO random that people are losing too soon (Nobody has made it to the last level)
- Sometimes if the phrases are too long the images won't appear but you can still guess it
- Sometimes it lags (could be just my laptop and internet arguing again)
- If the word or phrase starts off similar to the prior one the giphy api gives the same images
- Leaderboard updates but needs to be styled to look prettier it needs to visually shout what it is for the people out the back
- More words, more phrases

## NEW FUTURE FEATURES

- I wanna build my own random word|phrase API that can give words or quotes

- I came across something called local storage in my research - I WANNA USE THAT as soon as I learn how to do that I'm gonna add it

- Survival Mode: You get 7 lives and you gotta survive as many levels on that one set of lives, If you are on survival easy you get your guesses refreshed. If on hard, you run on the one set of 7 lives and 7 guesses.

- Music and sound effects: Will never start on, this is a toggle on feature

- Needs to be made responsive for use on all the commonly used screens/browsers

- Style it to be more readable

- Instead of the leaderboard appearing when you lose a game I should make it show on the first screenState so that people can see their old attempts and be motivated to beat their scores

- Make it so people all over the world can challenge each other

## LESSONS

- Don't be afraid of challenging things that you have either always struggled with or fear doing because if it didn't work the first time, it will the second time

- BE VERBAL - Always talk you thoughts outloud with every bit of code

- Write down your train of thought or ALWAYS do an audio/screenrecord THEN watch it (write notes on that)

- DON'T GIVE UP even if you know you are going to fail anyway keep trying, keep pushing. You can only improve. 

Thank you for being a part of my journey.

If you wanna see my original plans for the first version feel free to keep reading on...

First things first - What are the new requirements that I need to hit?

Now...Return to the drawing board.

- What worked?

- What didn't work?

- What could be improved?

- What should be removed?

- What challenges should I make to continue my growth?

For this I have decided to step into doing REACT js this was the program that destroyed my confidence and ability to think...After doing my best to tackle my weakness - I think I've come to really enjoy REACT js - I still have a lot to learn.

But there's nothing better than facing those struggles with a good set of free resources:

_[Introducing Hooks - React](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)_

_[Conditional Rendering - React](https://reactjs.org/docs/conditional-rendering.html#inline-if-with-logical--operator)_

_[Handling Events - React](https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html)_

_[React ES6 Arrow Functions - W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_es6_arrow.asp)_

After having the most relaxing bubble bath, a trip to the near by all you can eat pizza buffet and several hours of sleep in tears - I returned feeling ready to party. Somehow React is making sense!

Progress so far:

![Screenshot 2023-02-10 at 11 39 32 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116997107/218106085-d79cfe3b-107d-48ee-9f07-236dbb1fd105.png)

I'll need to practice explaining things on a low level, better breaking down of high level and observing what every tiny bit of code does at different points within the code. I really need to read real books written by people in my age group so that I can use better words and describe things properly. One step at a time.

![Screenshot 2023-02-12 at 11 29 55 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116997107/218314350-70cb9a76-9965-4429-9135-33799be158fa.png)

My progress so far has been slowed down by a lot of re-reading documentation on REACT JS - Learning how to explain things in a professional way ~ I'm not used to talking to adults or using real or related words to describe things I'm describing so that has definitely been a struggle for me. It's worth it though because in the real work environment I do need to be able to communicate better than I do now.

I hope that you enjoyed the journey of learning how to fail and experiment with REACT JS with me.

~ This time....I....present to you...my failed learning journey.

Unfortunately this version of the project failed....miserably....dumbly....inside a bucket of shame.

Do you know what we do to things inside a bucket of shame?

:fire: :notes: :notes: WE SET FIREEEEE TO THE SHAME ~ :notes: :notes: :fire:
(Yes in the tune of Adele's set fire to the rain that's just how I roll)

There is no link for the shame game.

This was for educational purposes so that I can learn how to code. If you happen to learn anything useful or have any advice for me to improve my skills please do tell :heart:

## Giphman

- Hangman but....using gifs!!!

The aim now is to create a pure front end app that uses a giphy API.

![Screenshot 2023-02-10 at 3 56 46 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116997107/217898053-9563e260-c920-4242-8081-6d868fa2eb78.png)

### TO HIT MVP REQUIREMENTS:

My teacher said that I just need to hit Version 2 and achieve a, b, c & d.

Below is screenshot proof of hitting that :heart:

1. Make the front-end app call the Giphy API and search for a random thing e.g. "bow"

![Screenshot 2023-02-10 at 1 57 02 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116997107/217872021-e82b377b-d927-4f6c-9f41-4f50011ef210.png)

![Screenshot 2023-02-10 at 2 01 09 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116997107/217872174-a40bacec-2e9d-4e19-9b2e-e40e5f3e98b1.png)

2. When the data comes back, the user can see a few images of the secret term.

![Screenshot 2023-02-10 at 2 02 36 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116997107/217872290-a7df82e0-f073-4831-8c04-ee9ff18ef35b.png)

3. The user then has to guess what the images are, so they are trying to correctly guess the secret thing e.g. "bow"

Version 1 - an input box where the user is typing what their guess is and comparing that to the secret thing.
![Screenshot 2023-02-10 at 2 05 24 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116997107/217872468-68378471-9c99-4cc6-8711-27a9ae272cab.png)

Version 2 - a hangman style game where each letter is represented as an empty box, and the user can click on the empty box and type in there. This is an empty box. That can be typed into.
![Screenshot 2023-02-10 at 2 06 38 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116997107/217873048-4e19f802-3f3e-4154-b2f2-53f028b162cc.png)

Each letter they type, if its correct, will display the letter inside the box, as well as the same letter used in other boxes e.g. the letter "e"
![Screenshot 2023-02-10 at 2 07 58 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116997107/217872854-5e9099e7-5b8a-4f7d-aa31-dd9ce5e4bcea.png)

If the letter they type is incorrect, do not write the letter into the box, and also increment the counter of incorrect guesses.

![Screenshot 2023-02-10 at 2 08 30 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116997107/217874010-7ea3b4cb-1ec5-45da-9713-b6d6b68eb560.png)

The counter of incorrect guesses is displayed to the user. Doesn't specifically say when or for how long.

![Screenshot 2023-02-10 at 2 11 10 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116997107/217874532-26a0e3b2-f773-4779-956c-2bca2d8c53cf.png)

Once they finish the entire word, you display a message to congratulate the user that they got it correct with X number of incorrect guesses.

![Screenshot 2023-02-10 at 2 16 25 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116997107/217875226-b30a180f-ffbe-421b-a99b-ce887fb6c1f4.png)

Version 3 - Add their score to a leaderboard.

This is the current plan:
![Screenshot 2023-02-08 at 5 17 48 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116997107/217461004-45970af1-f667-4462-99a8-5b8cb9d0d262.png)

## Pseudo Code

Pick a random word (APININJA)
Find hints (GIPHYAPI)

While (the word has not been guessed) {
Show the player their current progress
Get a guess from the player
If (the player wants to quit the game) {
Quit the game
}
Else If (the guess is not a single letter) {
Tell the player to pick a single letter
}
Else If (the guess is in the word) {
Update the player's progress with the guess
}
}
}
Congratulate the player on guessing the word

![Screenshot 2023-02-10 at 2 38 38 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116997107/217879407-6a58f27b-0b65-495b-b571-b7e919f0bccf.png)

## Toolkit

Due to time and skill limitations I kept it as simple as possible.....Now to figure out how to deploy...Or should I attempt doing a leaderboard?

HTML, JavaScript, CSS, DOM

## APIs Used

_[API Ninjas](https://api-ninjas.com/api/randomword)_

_[Giphy Developers](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api/#quick-start-guide)_

## Useful Resources

Okay so google.com & youtube.com has been a huge help but exactly what has been useful? If you're looking to make your own hangman - Definitely learn what HTML DOM Events are and experiment with everything you see.

_[W3schools - HTML DOM Events](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_event.asp)_

_[W3schools - CSS Gradients](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_gradients.asp)_

## Bugs

Some words don't seem to exist in Giphy and others do - Take this word for instance:

- Duplicidentata (No Have)
- Fovea (Actually does)

Some queries don't have enough items to have 3 gifs appear.

- unmalleable (only has 1 item available)

I'm ALWAYS a winner.[fixed]

Now...I'm losing lives at every guess be it right or wrong.[fixed]

Counters were not counting. [fixed]

Win/lose condition was not allowing anyone to win OR lose.[fixed]

Couldn't get the already used letters to print on the display[fixed]

Specific conditions need to be met to create problems.......This is for future, more skillful Inano to come through and fix...

![Screenshot 2023-02-08 at 7 14 59 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116997107/217881470-6d641ce0-bc01-42bb-a5e4-1aedfe7d63d4.png) [fixed]

## Where we came from to where we went...

Originally I was trying to make people guess a letter however the reset button didn't work, the counters didn't work and I just....Thought lets get rid of typing altogether.

![Screenshot 2023-02-09 at 2 18 22 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116997107/217690944-7500f919-20cb-465c-8dbc-8eae60f1c5bd.png)

As a result - I made a little alphabet board which was really cute but I had issues with letters converting into other letters and the styling got really bad looking.

![Screenshot 2023-02-09 at 3 17 36 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116997107/217690916-ea574455-7c34-40b1-8b55-fcf7484a412a.png)

Anddddd here I am....

![Screenshot 2023-02-09 at 11 23 34 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116997107/217690974-6bfe6f6f-7f31-41eb-89c7-9afebff2cfea.png)

Let's just take a moment to acknowledge this cheeky fella - It took me far too long to realise what needed to be fixed but feast your eyes! The always a winner or always a loser has been fixed!

![Screenshot 2023-02-09 at 2 55 13 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116997107/217722190-86e86f31-b1da-47bf-ad29-05bcafc87c95.png)

## Challenges...& Lessons...?

Oh so many challenges - at this point in time, as I learn how to code... I am slow in figuring out things for myself.

Ideas - Changing ideas.

Perception on what others say or request.

Grabbing DOM objects and then making them bend to my will was a huge hurdle.

A lot of the things I used to solve this was adaptions from my in class exercises, homework and there were times I binged watched youtube whilst reading articles on what DOM elements were and googling cultural differences between what I grew up understanding hangman was verses what I was being asked to make. Often I am shocked by how different they are.

Time, Knowledge and Patience was all against me. I learned a lot about my weaknesses.

TBH - Someone like me...here? Right now doing SOFTWARE ENGINEERING? HAHAHA Yeah Past me would have thought you were joking.

Take a seat kiddo ~ This is who we grew up to be, someone who loves challenges, enjoys learning and ever so passionately looks forward to the next emotional rollercoasters of debugging and building apps from scratch....in plain - vanilla javascript.

I've learnt that I can ACTUALLY do things I put my mind to

## Future Features

Ooooh If I had time this week!

Refresh the screen - Seriously...how did I only think of that NOW.

Leader board - Highest score in that level

Survivor board - Continue on a streak until your first unguessable word.

Actually add a hangman drawing in CSS to the right hand side (for now theres just a gap there for that)
