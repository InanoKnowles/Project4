# Project 4 - Anchor Point

Project 4 with General Assembly.
Project 4 is to DECIDE YOUR OWN PROJECT that pushes you OUTSIDE of your comfort zone AND looks visually pleasing.

At this point in time I have changed my project idea 3 times (currently idealess and bitter) SOOOOOooOoooOooo - I've decided to attempt something I have ZERO interest in that makes most people's eyes cringe at the sight of it.

## An RSS newsfeed

- RSS stands for many things, to different kinds of people.

For me it's ~> Really Simple Syndication (You know? Like...simple, standardized content distribution) Think of it as a digital version of a newspaper but each story/article can be clicked on to see more information on the topic. This is useful if you like to be quickly updated on things that interests you.
